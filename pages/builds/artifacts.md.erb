# Using Build Artifacts

In this guide we’ll walk through using the Buildkite Agent’s [artifact support](/docs/agent/cli-artifact) to store and retrieve files between different steps in a build pipeline.

## Uploading Artifacts

By default the agent will upload any artifacts you’ve specified in your build
step’s “Artifact Uploading” pattern:

<%= image 'artifact_pattern.png', size: '390x125', alt: 'Artifact pattern configuration' %>

For a detailed description of what path patterns are supported for artifact uploading, see the [Glob Path Pattern documentation](/docs/rest-api/artifacts#glob-path-pattern). 

You can also upload your own artifacts from your build scripts using
the `buildkite-agent artifact` command.

```bash
buildkite-agent artifact upload pkg/build.tar.gz
```

You can then download the artifact in subsequent build steps (even if the build step is running on a different build server).

## Downloading Artifacts

You can download artifacts created by a build step using the `buildkite-agent artifact download` command. For example:

```bash
buildkite-agent artifact download pkg/build.tar.gz pkg/
```

If an artifact exists at `pkg/build.tar.gz`, the above command will download it to the `pkg` directory at your destination. 

The path pattern for downloading artifacts differs slightly to those supported for uploading. For a detailed description of the syntax, see the [Glob Path Pattern documentation](/docs/rest-api/artifacts#glob-path-pattern). 

The `buildkite-agent artifact` command will find the last file uploaded with the matching filename, no matter which build step uploaded it. If you want to target an artifact from a particular build step use the `--job` argument. For example:

```bash
buildkite-agent artifact download build.zip tmp/ --job build
```

This will download the `build.zip` file from the pipeline step with the label "build".

## Downloading Artifacts Outside a Running Build

The `buildkite-agent artifact download` command only works within the context of a running build.

If you want to download an artifact from outside a build use our [Artifact Download API](/docs/api/artifacts#download-an-artifact).

## Further documentation

See the [Buildkite Agent artifact documentation](/docs/agent/cli-artifact) for a full list of options and details of Buildkite’s artifact support.
