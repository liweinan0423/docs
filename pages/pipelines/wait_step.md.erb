<%= toc %>

A *wait* step waits for all previous steps to have successfully completed before allowing following jobs to continue.

A basic wait step can be defined in your pipeline settings, or in your [pipeline.yml](/docs/pipelines/uploading-pipelines) file. It can be placed between steps to ensure that previous steps are successful before continuing to run the rest. 

```yml
- command: "command.sh"
- wait
- command: "echo The command passed"
```
